# go-round

> test coverage: 100%

Package round implements string-based decimal number rounding, parsing, and normalisation,
supporting scientific notation and un-mangling of malformed input.

Given it's string based, and it supports scientific notation, and doesn't place a hard limit on the
exponential, be careful.
